# administrative and per user settings go th the web UI.

# The strategy used for options in the default config shipped with gonic is to
# specify options with their default value where possible, and leave optional
# ones commented. Uncommented options override the default value. Options that
# are mandatory and need setting before first run have a placeholder for their
# values in <angle brackets>.
