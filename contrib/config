# This is the gonic server system-wide configuration file. For other
# administrative and per user settings go to the web UI.
#
# The strategy used for options in the default config shipped with gonic is to
# specify options with their default value where possible, and leave optional
# ones commented. Uncommented options override the default value. Options that
# are mandatory and need setting before first run have a placeholder for their
# values in <angle brackets>.

# Interface and port to listen on. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:4747
listen-addr                 127.0.0.1:4747

# HTTP(S) request logging
#http-log                    true
# URL path prefix to use if behind reverse proxy
#proxy-prefix                <prefix>

# Secure connection settings. Recommended to set up unless gonic sits behind an
# SSL enabled reverse proxy server. Disabled by default.
#tls-cert                    <path to TLS certificate>
#tls-key                     <path to TLS private key>

# gonic's internal state database location
db-path                     /var/lib/gonic/gonic.db

# Path to music files. Must be specified at least once, but can be specified
# multiple times if the collection is split into different
# directories. E.g.:
# music-path                  /srv/audio/music
music-path                  <path to your music dir>

# Path to downloaded podcast files. Must be specified. E.g.:
# podcast-path                /var/cache/podcast
podcast-path                <path to your podcasts dir>

# gonic manages playlists as m3u files. This way users can also edit these
# playlists themselves or add custom ones via other tools. Items in the
# directory should be placed in subdirectories matching user IDs in the
# database, in the format `<userid>/<name>.m3u`. For example the admin user could
# have 1/my-playlist.m3u. E.g.:
# playlists-path             /srv/audio/playlists
playlists-path              <path to your m3u playlist dir>

# Age (in days) to purge podcast episodes if not accessed. Disabled by default.
#podcast-purge-age           0

# Directory where transcoded audio files and covers are stored. It's safe to
# delete contents periodically (see tmpfilesd configuration), as it will be
# regenerated.
cache-path                  /var/cache/gonic

# Interval (in minutes) to check for new music. Default: don't scan
#scan-interval               0
#scan-at-start-enabled       false
#scan-watcher-enabled        false
#jukebox-enabled             false
#jukebox-mpv-extra-args      <extra command line arguments to pass to the jukebox mpv daemon>

# Metadata multi-value handling
# gonic supports parsing mult-valued tags in the metadata thus assigning a song
# to several genres or album artists. This improves search and reduces clutter
# in the artist/genre listing. Accepted options are:
#   multi: gonic will explicitly look for multi value fields the audio metadata
#   delim <delimiter character>: gonic will look at the regular audio metadata
#                                fields like "genre" or "album_artist", but split
#                                them on a delimiter. For example to split on
#                                semicolon set the option value to be "delim ;"
#   none: default setting, gonic won't attempt to do any multi value parsing
#multi-value-genre          none
#multi-value-album-artist   none
